## Task

Your task is to build a full-stack application with **any** of the technologies of your choice that we've learned in this cohort. React, Redux, Vue, Mongo, Sequelize, Django, Flexbox or Grid. The choice is yours! You can also use any outside technologies of your choice with instructor approval.


## Project Due Dates
- Project Pitches Due **Thursday 5/5 at 9:00AM EST**
- Projects Due **Monday 5/16 at 11:00AM EST**

## For Project Approval

- Detailed README (Name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used)
- Full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the backend
- Component Component Hierarchy Diagram (Lucidchart or other) for the frontend
- Trello Board 
- Project must be _well-scoped_, meaning that you can capably reach MVP by the due date

## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**
- Be a **new repo** 
- Have separate directories for the frontend (client) and backend within the main repository
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Your README should have links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Include a minimum of 3 models (Postgres, Sequelize, or Mongoose)
- Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model
- Use functional components with React hooks or with React Redux. Your project cannot have class components.
- Have at least **60 _meaningful_ `git` commits** - You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). 
- Be deployed 

## Post-MVP Ideas
- Integrate a 3rd party API: [Here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- Integrate a UI Library, you can find a vetted list: [Here](https://gist.github.com/anpato/a35d201aa96f0945013a2cfa8253d3ff)
- Integrate Mapbox or Geolocation: [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/)
- Implement Data Visualization or Charting: [Here](https://dev.to/giteden/top-5-react-chart-libraries-for-2020-1amb)
- Implement Oauth with Auth0: [auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- If you are using Vue, implement Vuex: [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/#what-is-a-state-management-pattern)
- Utilize a query library React/Vue Query: [React](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) | [Vue](https://vue-query.vercel.app/#/)
- Implement Web Sockets: [socket.io](https://socket.io/)

## Tips
- Build your project with a mobile-first styling approach
- Commit early (day one or two) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Implement all project requirements first before moving on to post-mvp features
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase - it could land you a job)

## A Note on Plagiarism
  
- Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for immediate withdrawal.
- You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and Stack Overflow for help. However, it is <b><i>not acceptable to copy</i></b> another persons code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.
- Small snippets of code that solve small problems taken from Stack Overflow are generally an exception to this rule. If you aren't sure, it is your responsibility to <b><i>ask your instructor</i></b>. To be on the safe side, we ask that you credit the person/resource you got the code from in a comment, and let an instructor take a look at it.
